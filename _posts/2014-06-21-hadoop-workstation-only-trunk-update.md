# Introduction

I decided to revist Hadoop trunk today to see how easy it is to get
everything (HDFS + MapReduce) working. The good news is, it's gotten
really easy!

## Reservations

- I've only tested on MacOS X. At some point I'll try Linux.
- I've not tried native code-building yet.

# Build

# Start HDFS and MapReduce

## Format NN

# Test HDFS

# Test MapReduce
